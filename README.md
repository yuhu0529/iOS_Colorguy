This is an example of using Parse with Phonegap to upload a picture taken with the camera.

Example is primarily a copy of Raymond Camden's tutorial available here: http://www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm/2013/7/23/Better-example-of-PhoneGap-Parse-and-uploading-files

I tweaked this example to make it work with the camera instead of the photo album.
